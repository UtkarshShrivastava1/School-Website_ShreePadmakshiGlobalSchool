An indispensable part of the students training, our language labs are well- equipped with polished study material, smart-interactive boards, headphones and projectors for a splendid experience. Learning language enables a child to understand the world in a much better manner. The child is thus exposed to unfamiliar cultures and traditions, comes to know about the variations of ethnicities around the globe and interacts with people with a wider assortment of knowledge and awareness. The language faculty with innovative active sessions and motivating guidance instill the love for languages in our students. Technological assistance helps the child to not only understand the language but also to experience it a never-happened-before mode.'

With development in teaching methods, which have become more and more experimental, learning mathematical concepts requires special training. This intricate puzzle needs to be solved outside the classroom, away from mere theoretical approach. SPGS makes this work even easier with its math lab which endows the child with insight into mathematical formulae, collection of data and rectifying errors through experimentation. The math lab consists of all the required material for a fascinating experience of the subject making mathematical studies a piece of cake.'
